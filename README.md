# Unit-12-EmployeeTracker
Unit 12. 

In this assignment We have been tasked with created a node application that shows an employee database. 
Using MYSQL we created a schema of three [3] tables consisting of Employee Info, their Role, and a list of the companies Departments.

Using characters from the Office my Seed file will have all the info required to create the tables required to run this application. 

MYSQL went very well. Fortunatly I feel like I actually maybe might possibly be able to perform these tasks as required. 

However, as usual the utilization of JavaScript always hinders my progress. 
Fortunately I was actually able to deliver on SOME of the required functionality. 

Despite being unable to figure out how to get all 3 tables to show up together 
----(I was looking into "joins" but my efforts weren't fruitful)----
I was able to eventually figure out how to render the information seperately in their own respective tables. 

Despite this assignment being yet another horrible failure on my part. I can say, that I have actually seen some progress in my abilities. I'm still surpries that I was even able to get ANYTHING to show up at all. 

So take the app for a spin (begin the app with "node index.js" command)
